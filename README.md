# Hi! My name is *FABIANA* 
##
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects I've completed using Power BI, Python, and SQL. Each project reflects my skills in data analysis, visualization, and turning raw data into actionable insights.

Below you'll find links and short descriptions for each project.

#[Bellabeat Case Study](https://github.com/fabi4d/BellabeatCaseStudy)

Bellabeat is a company that creates product for women. One of their latest products is a smart device that women can use to track their health. In this case study I will use FitBit secondary data to gain insights about smart tracker usage. The datasets and some instructions were provided by Google Data Analytics, which is a course on Coursera, developed by Google. I will analyze FitBit's data to find some problems Bellabeat might face with their new product and provide recommendations based on that study.
